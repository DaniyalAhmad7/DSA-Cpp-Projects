# All Sort Algorithms

This project showcases implementations of various sorting algorithms in C++. Each algorithm demonstrates a different approach to sorting a list of numbers. The project is designed to help understand how different sorting techniques work and their efficiency in terms of iterations and complexity.

## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science. This project includes five popular sorting algorithms implemented in C++. Each algorithm is chosen for its unique method of sorting and varying efficiency, which provides a broad understanding of sorting mechanisms.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Bubble Sort
**Description:** Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats until the list is sorted.

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.

**Link:** [Bubble Sort Implementation](sort_algorithms/bubblesort.cpp)

### Selection Sort
**Description:** Selection Sort divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.

**Link:** [Selection Sort Implementation](sort_algorithms/selectionsort.cpp)

### Insertion Sort
**Description:** Insertion Sort builds the sorted list one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.

**Time Complexity:** O(n^2) in the worst and average cases.

**Link:** [Insertion Sort Implementation](sort_algorithms/insertionsort.cpp)

### Merge Sort
**Description:** Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) in all cases.

**Link:** [Merge Sort Implementation](sort_algorithms/mergesort.cpp)

### Quick Sort
**Description:** Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot element, partitions the list around the pivot, and recursively sorts the partitions.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) on average, O(n^2) in the worst case.

**Link:** [Quick Sort Implementation](sort_algorithms/quicksort.cpp)
